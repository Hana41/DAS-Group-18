# Dallas Animal Shelter Analysis

## Overview

The repository contains analysis of data collected from the Dallas Animal Shelter. The purpose of the project is to investigate the factors that influence the number of days an animal spends at the shelter before deciding on a final outcome.

## Data Description

The datasets used in this analysis consist of information recorded for each animal admitted to the Dallas animal shelter. Each dataset contains the following variables:

- Animal_type: The type of animal admitted to the shelter.
- Month: The month the animal was admitted, recorded numerically with January=1.
- Year: The year the animal was admitted to the shelter.
- Intake_type: Reason for the animal being admitted to the shelter.
- Outcome_type: Final outcome for the admitted animal.
- Chip_Status: Did the animal have a microchip with owner information?
- Time_at_Shelter: Days spent at the shelter between being admitted and the final outcome.

## Analysis Method

The analysis is conducted using a Generalised Linear Model (GLM). GLM allows us to model the relationship between the response variable (Time_at_Shelter) and the predictor variables (Animal_type, Month, Year, Intake_type, Outcome_type, and Chip_Status).
